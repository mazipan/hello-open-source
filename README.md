## 💰 Is this data collection?

No, this is for learning purpose only.

## 🥶 Do I need to attach my real name?

No, just put any data. Non-sense, we just want to learn a flow to contribute in open source code.

We don't collect the data, but there is chance for other people to abuse your data that is submitted here.
Please do it with your own risk, **we don't protect your data**.

## ⤵️ How do I retrieve someone's data?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mazipan/hello-open-source # clone the repo
cd hello-open-source # cd into the repo
node index.js caxvis # will return this person's named caxvis to you
```

## 🗑️ How to remove my data?

Remove all data

```shell
yarn purge
```

You can specify a name (or more) to remove only those file(s)
